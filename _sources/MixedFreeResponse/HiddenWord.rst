The following is a free response question from 2015.  It was question 2 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 2.** Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital
letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the
hidden word.  

After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.

    Figure 1: The hints 
    
The ``HiddenWord`` class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game.  The hidden word is passed to the constructor.  The class contains a method, ``getHint`` that takes a guess and produces a hint.  

For example, suppose the variable ``puzzle`` is declared as follows.

.. code-block:: java

    HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord("HARPS");
    
The following table shows several guesses and the hints that would be produced.

Try and Solve It
----------------

Write the complete ``Hidden Word`` class, including any necessary instance variables, its constructor, and the method,
``getHint``, described above. You may assume that the length of the guess is the same as the length of
the hidden word.

The code below has comments to help you get started.  It also has a main method for testing.  Finish writing the class and use the main method to test it.

.. activecode:: HiddenWordClass
   :language: java

   // Declare the HiddenWord class below
   
   {
   
       /** Declare any fields (instance variables) **/

       /** Declare a constructor */

       /** Write the getHint method */
    
       /** This is a main method for testing the class */
       public static void main(String[] args)
       {
           HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord("HARPS");
           System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("AAAAA") + " it should print +A+++");
           System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HELLO") + " it should print H****");
           System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HEART") + " it should print H*++*");
           System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HARMS") + " it should print HAR*S");
           System.out.println(puzzle.getHint("HARPS") + " it should print HARPS");
       
       } // end of main

   } // end of class
